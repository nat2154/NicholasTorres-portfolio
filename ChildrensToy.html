  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>Designed a purely mechanical children’s counting toy that physically demonstrates addition and subtraction using marbles, without electronics or screens. The goal was to make arithmetic visible and intuitive by showing quantities combine and decrease through controlled mechanical motion, while creating a closed-loop system that supports repeated use without loose parts.
</p>

  <h3>Concept & User Interaction</h3>
      <p>The toy operates using three connected chambers. Two outer chambers store marbles representing input values, and a central chamber displays the result. Pressing a button on either side releases marbles from that chamber, which roll along guided paths and collect in the center to demonstrate addition. Subtraction is performed by pressing a separate control that removes marbles from the center chamber one at a time, allowing the child to see the quantity decrease directly. A reset mechanism clears the center chamber and lifts the marbles back into the storage chambers, completing a fully self-contained cycle.

    <h3>Mechanical Design & CAD Strategy</h3>
    <p>
The entire CAD model was built around a single driving dimension—the marble diameter—so all openings, ramps, gates, and elevator pockets scale consistently if the marble size changes. Flow control is handled through mechanical geometry rather than electronics or software: sliding gate plates uncover marble-sized openings, internal walls keep quantities separated until triggered, and geometric stops define motion limits without relying on mate constraints. Symmetry tools and mirrored features were used to maintain identical behavior on both sides and reduce rework.

    <h3>Subsystem Design Highlights</h3>
      <p>A one-marble elevator system was designed to reset the toy without manual handling. The platform includes a dedicated marble pocket and a blocking wall that prevents multiple marbles from entering, acting as a mechanical check valve. Thin internal dividers separate left and right channels while preserving stiffness, and ramps and guide walls ensure predictable marble motion throughout the system.</p>

 <h3>Challenges & Engineering Tradeoffs</h3>

  <p>
Preventing jamming and marble escape was the primary challenge. Instead of relying on extremely tight tolerances, the design prioritizes containment through retaining lips, sidewalls, ribs, and controlled ramp geometry. Ramp angles were iterated to balance smooth motion without bouncing or stalling. Wall thicknesses were tuned to maintain durability while preserving space for internal channels. Several components were intentionally separated into multiple bodies to reflect realistic fabrication, assembly, and animation rather than idealized single-part geometry.
</p>
  
  <h3> Results & Takeaways</h3>
  <p>The final design clearly communicates the logic of addition and subtraction through physical motion, maintains reliable marble control, and reflects practical mechanical design principles focused on durability, clarity, and repeatable operation. The project demonstrates parametric CAD modeling, mechanism-driven logic, tolerance-aware design, and user-centered mechanical problem solving.</p>
