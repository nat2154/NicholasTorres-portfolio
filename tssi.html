  <h2>Problem Statement & Goal</h2>
  <p>
The Tractive System Status Indicator (TSSI) is the primary visual safety device that communicates the high-voltage (HV) state of the tractive system to the driver, team members, and event officials. It must clearly indicate when the tractive system is energized, precharging, or safe, and is required by FSAE Electric rules as a core safety component.  </p>
<p>This year, the Low-Voltage Enclosures team was tasked with completely redesigning the TSSI to address several issues with the previous version—including waterproofing failures, rule changes regarding mounting, and overall improvements to reliability, manufacturability, and aerodynamic cleanliness. The goal was to deliver a fully waterproof, compact, resin-printed TSSI that meets rule requirements, fits on welded chassis tabs, and withstands real competition conditions.</p>
  <h2>Procedure / Workflow</h2>
    <h3>
    Establishing Requirements
    </h3>
      <p>
      I began by reviewing the FSAE rules governing TSSI brightness, visibility, mounting, and electrical interfacing to ensure full compliance before any modeling work started. From there, I analyzed the shortcomings of last year’s TSSI—specifically water ingress, the instability of clamp-style mounting, excessive surface area, and tolerance issues caused by FDM printing. I also identified internal constraints that would influence the design direction, including the electrical team’s transition to a 24 V standard for LV lights, the team’s shift toward resin-based manufacturing, and the fixed placement of welded chassis mounting tabs. Together, these external rules and internal constraints shaped the initial set of design requirements.

    <h3>
    Waterproofing & Gasket Optimization
    </h3>
      <p>
      To develop a fully waterproof system, I created multiple enclosure prototypes with varied gasket groove depths and widths, testing each design to determine how compression levels affected sealing reliability. After repeated iterations, I finalized a configuration using 15% compression on a ⅛-inch X-ring profile O-ring for the main enclosure seal. For the LED lights themselves, I produced custom-cut gasket sheets that matched their exact geometry and mounting screw patterns. These tailored gaskets enabled precise, consistent sealing at all light interfaces and improved long-term protection against water ingress.
      </p>
    <h3>
     Material & Manufacturing Process Selection 
    </h3>
      <p>
        Selecting the appropriate manufacturing process was essential to achieving both strength and waterproofing. I chose resin-based SLA/MSLA printing for the TSSI housing because of its near-zero porosity, consistent wall thickness, and superior tolerance control compared to FDM. These characteristics made it possible to design tight, reliable O-ring glands, achieve crisp edges around cutouts, and produce a fully waterproof enclosure. Resin printing also improved overall dimensional accuracy, allowing the design to meet the tight sealing requirements demanded by the environment.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Rule-Driven Mounting Redesign
    </h3>
      <p>
        With new FSAE rules prohibiting clamp mounting on the roll hoop, I rethought the mounting approach entirely. I modeled the TSSI in SolidWorks and positioned it near the top of the roll hoop, then collaborated with the chassis team to design welded mounting tabs that met rule requirements while avoiding interference with wiring paths, screw clearances, and surrounding components. This process ensured a rule-compliant, structurally reliable mounting system that integrated cleanly with the existing chassis architecture.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Surface-Area Reduction & Aerodynamic Cleanup
    </h3>
      <p>
        To reduce aerodynamic drag and create a more compact design, I researched DOT/SAE-certified lights that met the minimum luminous-area requirements without unnecessary size. Using these, I iteratively repositioned the light modules and trimmed excess geometry to minimize the enclosure’s external surface area. This not only decreased the TSSI’s frontal area—improving airflow and reducing pressure buildup—but also resulted in a cleaner, more efficient overall form factor.
