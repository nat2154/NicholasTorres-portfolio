  <h2>Problem Statement & Goal</h2>
  <p>The dashboard enclosure houses the driver’s primary low-voltage interface and includes a MoTeC display, driver-critical indicator lights (BMS, IMD, BSPD), torque/traction LEDs, buttons for MoTeC mode changes, the RTD button, traction-control switches, regenerative braking and off-switches, and multiple rotary dials. These components must be arranged in a way that maximizes driver visibility, ergonomic reach, and safety while protecting all electronics from water, dust, vibration, and structural loading during competition.
This year’s goal was to redesign the dashboard enclosure to address key weaknesses from previous seasons:
<ul>Improving visibility of the MoTeC and all lights/switches.


Replacing temporary zip-tie mounting with rigid chassis-mounted tabs.


Adding internal structural support strong enough to resist E-brake forces.


Completely waterproofing the enclosure using gasket grooves and custom-cut gasket sheets.


Expanding and reshaping the enclosure to support a much larger component count while maintaining clean driver-side ergonomics.


Transitioning to a carbon-fiber-reinforced resin material for increased stiffness and environmental durability.</ul></p>
