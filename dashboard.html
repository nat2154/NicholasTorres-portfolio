  <h2>Problem Statement & Goal</h2>
  <p>The dashboard enclosure houses the driver’s primary low-voltage interface and includes a MoTeC display, driver-critical indicator lights (BMS, IMD, BSPD), torque/traction LEDs, buttons for MoTeC mode changes, the RTD button, traction-control switches, regenerative braking and off-switches, and multiple rotary dials. These components must be arranged in a way that maximizes driver visibility, ergonomic reach, and safety while protecting all electronics from water, dust, vibration, and structural loading during competition.
This year’s goal was to redesign the dashboard enclosure to address key weaknesses from previous seasons:
<ul>
<li>Improving visibility of the MoTeC and all lights/switches. </li>


<li>Replacing temporary zip-tie mounting with rigid chassis-mounted tabs.</li>


<li>Adding internal structural support strong enough to resist E-brake forces. </li>


<li>Completely waterproofing the enclosure using gasket grooves and custom-cut gasket sheets.</li>


<li>Expanding and reshaping the enclosure to support a much larger component count while maintaining clean driver-side ergonomics.</li>


<li>Transitioning to a carbon-fiber-reinforced resin material for increased stiffness and environmental durability.</li>
</ul>
</p>

  <h2>Procedure / Workflow</h2>
    <h3>Requirements Definition & Packaging Constraints
     <p>I began the project by clearly defining the functional requirements and the physical constraints of the dashboard. Using the attached component list as a reference, I identified all elements that needed to be packaged into the enclosure: the MoTeC display, torque and traction LEDs, the RTD button, BMS/IMD/BSPD lights, the traction control switch and indicator, the regenerative braking switch, the off switch, buttons for MoTeC page changes, and multiple rotary dials. From this inventory, I established the spatial and ergonomic requirements, focusing on visibility from the driver’s seated position, reach accessibility, cable-routing paths, and the overall enclosure volume. The largest packaging constraints were the MoTeC’s significant footprint and the high number of indicator lights that had to remain visible behind the steering wheel. Ensuring that everything fit within the dashboard boundaries while maintaining a clean and functional layout guided the rest of the design process.</p>
    <h3>SolidWorks Modeling & Component Layout</h3>
     <p>The enclosure was developed entirely in SolidWorks using solid modeling and placed into the full vehicle assembly through standard mates rather than parametric linking. I started with the front panel, modeling all required cutouts for lights, switches, and dials, and then iteratively adjusting the geometry to accommodate visibility and reach. The MoTeC’s position required repeated refinement; I experimented with its angle and depth relative to the steering wheel until the display was fully readable from the driver’s point of view. The indicator lights and buttons were rearranged numerous times—testing layouts that involved extruding key components upward, extending the MoTeC outward, and shifting clusters—until I arrived at a configuration that fit everything without obstruction. Behind the panel, I accounted for adequate wiring clearance and ensured that every connector had sufficient depth and routing space.</p>
    <h3>Structural Reinforcement for E-Brake Loading</h3>
      <p>Because the E-brake transmits force directly into the dashboard structure, I strengthened the enclosure by adding three internal cylindrical support columns that extend from the back surface of the enclosure to its mounting interface. These columns distribute applied braking loads through the enclosure instead of concentrating them at a thin panel section. As a result, they prevent deformation of the front panel, reduce localized stress at the E-brake mounting area, and protect the enclosure from cracking under high-force driver inputs. This reinforcement provided a substantial stiffness increase with minimal implications for weight or packaging.</p>
    <h3>Waterproofing Strategy</h3>
      <p>For waterproofing, I applied the lessons learned from the team’s earlier O-ring prototype testing. I incorporated a full perimeter gasket groove between the enclosure and its lid to ensure a consistent sealing interface. Additionally, I designed shallow gasket seats around individual component cutouts, allowing custom-cut gasket sheets to seal each light and switch footprint. Because different components required different structural and sealing approaches, I used a mix of front-mounted and rear-mounted hardware. Altogether, these strategies ensure that the electronics facing the driver remain isolated from rain, spray, and track contaminants.</p>
    <h3>Material Transition to Carbon-Fiber Resin System</h3>
      <p>With a newly secured sponsor providing a carbon-fiber–reinforced resin system, the dashboard will be fabricated using this CF-resin material instead of standard printing polymers. This transition improves stiffness, impact resistance, long-term dimensional stability, and natural waterproofing characteristics. The enclosure is designed in two pieces—a front panel and a back housing—that will be printed separately and assembled with fasteners, taking full advantage of the CF-resin’s superior structural properties.</p>
