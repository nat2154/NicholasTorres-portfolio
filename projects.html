    <h3>TSSI – Tractive System Status Indicator</h3>
    <p>I redesigned our Formula SAE team’s TSSI to be fully waterproof, structurally stronger, and significantly more compact. The new housing uses resin printing for tight tolerances, integrates optimized O-ring sealing, and mounts directly to welded roll-hoop tabs per updated FSAE rules. By reducing surface area, improving aerodynamics, and accommodating evolving 12–24 V electrical standards, the final design delivers a durable, serviceable, and race-ready indicator system.</p>

    <h3>Dashboard Enclosure</h3>
    <p>DI developed a new driver dashboard enclosure designed around the MoTeC display, indicator lights, switches, and rotary controls while ensuring full visibility and ergonomic access behind the wheel. Using iterative SolidWorks layout, internal load-bearing supports, and a comprehensive waterproofing strategy, I produced a compact, structurally reinforced, carbon-fiber–ready enclosure that integrates cleanly with the vehicle and supports reliable electronics operation during competition.</p>
